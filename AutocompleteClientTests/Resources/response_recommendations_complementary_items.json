Smoked with natural hardwoods. Gluten free. Pork used raised without hormones. Federal regulations prohibit the use of hormones in pork. The slower we make it, the faster you eat it. What is there to think about? The bacon all other bacons aspire to be is in your hands. There's a reason we're America's favorite brand of bacon and it's not just because we've been crafting it for 90 years. We take our sweet, delicious time curing it for 12 hours and then sending it off to our natural hardwood smokehouse for hours. Just don't blame us if it only lasts 12 seconds.
